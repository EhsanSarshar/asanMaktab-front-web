# Welcome to asanMaktab!

I really proud of you that intended to help us to build this awesome project


# Tech stack

we are using **React.js** for front-end and we are intent to make a **PWA** app. so if you have React.js knowledge or **PWA** your mostly welcome. but if you don't have **React.js** knowledge but have **JS** knowledge you can still help us with some app logics. if you don't have any of these knowledge you can help us with Issue reporting and bug fixing

## Things to observe

please don't put extra space and also observe the the coding style as it is.
we are using ES7 so please use most update JS features prefer `let` on `var` and other things. we are to use only ***react hooks*** so plz don't use ***class*** components
